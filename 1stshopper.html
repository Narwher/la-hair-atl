							<p> 
								This is a Hair Weave Notice the client's own natural hair is completely covered.
								<br> <br/>
								This client's natural hair is braided in a circle therefore the hair does not have a natural projection, the head appears large (especially at the top), and the scalp cannot breath. 
							</p>
						</td>
						
						<td>
							<p> 
								This is a Hair Enhancement First, notice the perfectly natural look of the style. This client has a choice of styles.
								<br> <br/>
								She can even wear a high ponytail. Her head has a normal, natural looking shape.
								<br> <br/>
								If you saw this lady in public, you would think that this was her own hair - Right?
